- Before this change, when user presses back-to-top button, they are instantly teleported to the top of the page. This might seem abrupt. So instead, I changed it so that when user presses the back-to-top button, they will be smooth scrolled to the top. Done via javascript.

- Added google analytics to website to track user engagement
- To do this, I created a google analytics account and added a google third party script to each of my website's pages.

- Added back-to-top button in experiences and projects page to allow user to instantly go to the top of the page. The button always floats in the bottom right corner and can be seen once the user scrolls 100px down the window. The visibility of the button is handled via javascript. 
- Finished part one, native dialogs.
