				FillSolver is an Android Application that solves puzzles generated by the game Fill One-Line Puzzle
				Game. It is a game where you have to fill in all the squares on the gameboard with a single,
				non-overlapping path. This project started off as a result of a friendly competition between my
				girlfriend and I to see who can solve more puzzles. As I was playing, I remembered a previous project I
				had done where I created a solver for the word game Boggle using recursive backtracking. Fill and Boggle
				share a lot of commonalities because they both have a grid as the gameboard and both games' solutions
				consist of contiguous grid cells lining up together. Initially, I created a command line program for
				FillSolver that used the same algoritihm as Boggle. However, the interface was very clunky and involved
				the user punching in a bunch of grid coordinates to reproduce the gameboard. In college after I learned
				Android, I was able to go back to this project to create an Android application for it, allowing for a
				much better user experience.

				This project was a group effort created for Yale Hacks 2020. Our goal is to create a social media app to
				help college students check up on each other at a glance and to provide a shared, personal space where
				honesty and vulnerability is not only welcomed, but encouraged. For the project, we used Java to do
				Android programming. We used the Android Studios IDE to help us code as well as get an emulator that can
				run our code. We used FirebaseUI for the user authentication, Firebase realtime database for storing
				user data, and Firebase Storage for storing profile pictures.

				This project is a python script that checks the price of a Royal Carribean Cruise that I wanted to go on
				and will email me whenever the price dips below a certain price. At the time, I had wanted to learn some
				Python so I decided to write this script using Python, taking advantage of the Beautiful Soup library to
				scrape the cruise price from their website.
